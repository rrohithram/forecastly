# Forecastly

A minimal weather app made using Flutter and OpenWeatherMap's API key. It is also responsive. Based on the mode of the device, the app's theme also changes.
Animations are from LottieFiles!

Use the ```git clone https://github.com/rrohithram/forecastly``` command to clone this project!

Feel free to add your own API key in the ```WeatherMainPage.dart``` file!
